          <h2>T-SHIRT FABRIC &amp; INK</h2>
          <p>
            Our unisex t-shirts are all 100% cotton, made of fine Portuguese
            jersey which has been treated to provide softness and durability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our female fit is made with a blend of cotton and modal Portuguese
            jersey.
          </p>
          <p>
            We only print with high-quality water-based inks, which are not only
            environmentally friendly but also give a soft touch to every design.

            In every local Typographia store we have a different t-shirt design
            selection. This means that in our online store you will find
            different designs from the ones you can find in our physical stores
            and vice-versa.
          </p>
          <p>
            We post a fresh selection of new designs in our online store
            regularly. Sign your e-mail here to receive our updates.

            You can exchange t-shirts within 30 days of receiving the order,
            provided the items are in their original condition. Returns and
            refunds are only possible 14 days after receiving the order.
          </p>

            If you bought the t-shirt(s) in our physical stores, it's possible
            to exchange them for another size within 30 days of the purchase
            date. For any purchase made in a store that is temporarily closed,
            we will extend the exchange period.
