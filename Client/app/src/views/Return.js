            proceed with the refund of your items. A credit will automatically

            If you haven’t received your refund yet, please first contact your
            credit card company, as it may take some time before it gets
            credited to your account. There is often a certain processing period
            involved - please allow up to 15 working days for the refund to be
            fulfilled.
